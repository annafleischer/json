  "text": "Anger is just another emotion that we can feel, and it’s perfectly OK to feel. Anger can feel like you’re a steaming pot that’s boiling over with the lid left on. And you need to release your anger in the right way, and take the lid off the pot. It helps to talk about your anger with an adult or a friend and not let it go out of control.",
